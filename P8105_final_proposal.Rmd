## Project Title
**Rodent Inspection Patterns in New York City: A Data-Driven Analysis Using R**


## Motivation
In densely populated cities like New York City, rodent infestations are not only a nuisance but also pose significant public health risks, as rodents can spread diseases and contaminate food sources. Managing rodent populations effectively is essential for urban sanitation and the well-being of residents. This project seeks to analyze NYCâ€™s rodent inspection data from the Rat Information Portal (RIP), alongside food scrap drop-off locations and socioeconomic indicators, to uncover patterns and factors that influence rodent activity. By understanding these trends, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve pest control strategies, optimize resource allocation, and support public health initiatives in NYC.


## Intended Final Products
A website containing:

* **Report**: A written analysis highlighting findings and insights derived from data analysis
* **Model Analysis**:  Description of data sources and the cleaning process; Methodology; EDA results, regression, ...
* **Dashboards**: Visual representations of rat activity and food scrap locations by neighborhood, with time-based filters
* **Screencast**: A video about the summary of our key highlights


## Anticipated Data Sources
All data for this analysis covers the period from January 2020 to August 2024, aligning with our research focus and ensuring consistency across datasets.<br>

1. **Rodent Inspection Data in NYC**: Provides detailed records of rodent inspection results across New York City, is the main dataset of our study.<br>
   [Data Source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj/about_data)

2. **Food Scrap Drop-Off Locations in NYC**: Details the locations for food scrap drop-off points across NYC neighborhoods, allowing us to analyze their correlation with rat activity patterns.<br>
   [Data Source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Food-Scrap-Drop-Off-Locations-in-NYC/if26-z6xq/about_data)

3. **Socioeconomic Data**:
   - **Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)**: Measures typical observed market rent across NYC, which helps in understanding how rent levels might relate to rat activity in various neighborhoods. ZORI captures rental trends in a repeat-rent index, reflecting the overall rental market. <br>
     [Data Source](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)
   - **Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)**: Reflects typical home values across regions, showing property values and their changes in different neighborhoods.<br>

## Planned Analyses, Visualizations, and Coding Challenges

**Data Analysis**

Time Series Analysis: Analyze rat activity over time by examining inspection data on a monthly or quarterly basis. Create trend charts to identify high-risk months and compare weekday versus weekend patterns.

Geographic Analysis: Map inspection data across NYC to highlight areas with high rat activity.

Regression Model: We hypothesized that rat activity would be associated with food scrap drop-off location, seasonal variation, and socioeconomic factors. To test our hypothesis, we planned to use regression analysis to explore the associations between food scrap drop-off, seasonal variation, socioeconomic factors, and rat activity.

Spatiotemporal Distribution: Develop an animated map to show changes in rodent activity over time across NYC neighborhoods. This will reveal spatiotemporal patterns, making it easier to see how rodent activity evolves monthly or quarterly in different regions.

**Visualizations**

We plan to use both plot/table and dashboard.

*Plot/table*

Statistical table by area:
Summarize the frequency of rodent activity and distribution of food scrap drop-off in different boroughs (eg Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.)

Time period table by season:
Displays rodent activity data in different seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), and counts inspection results by month.

Statistical table by socioeconomic factors:
Combined with socioeconomic data (such as rent, and housing price, etc.) to count rat infestation activities by region.

*Dashboard*

Heatmap of Rodent Activity:
Map rodent activity inspection data onto a map of NYC to create a heatmap or scatter plot to show the geographic distribution of rodent activity and identify high-risk areas.

Rodent Activity Over Time:
Show a time series plot of rodent activity, showing the pass/fail rate of rodent inspections by month or quarter to observe trends in rodent activity over time to see if there are seasonal or long-term trends.

Rodent activity and socioeconomic factors:
Generate a scatter plot or bar chart showing the relationship between socioeconomic factors and rodent activity frequency.

**Coding Challenges**

First of all, the amount of data about Rodent inspection is huge, with more than 2.6 million data points. We predicted that it would be difficult to organize this huge database. At the same time, we will use multiple databases to merge. How to merge the multiple databases one by one is also a difficulty we need to overcome.

Secondly, in this study, we may use regression analysis, but we may encounter multicollinearity problems in the process, which requires us to think about reasonable optimization methods.


## Planned Timeline

### Nov. 8 - Nov. 11: Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Load, inspect, and clean the rodent inspection dataset along with additional datasets (food scrap drop-off locations, socioeconomic data).

### Nov. 11 - Nov. 15: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct a project review meeting.
- Perform EDA to identify patterns in inspection types, outcomes, and distributions across boroughs.

### Nov. 15 - Nov. 27: Further Analysis
- Conduct geospatial and time series analyses.
- Develop a regression model to explore relationships between rodent activity, environmental factors, and socioeconomic data.
- Begin building interactive dashboards.

### Nov. 27 - Dec. 7: Final Report and Dashboard Development
- Summarize findings and complete the final report.
- Finalize the project webpage.
- Record and publish an explanatory video online.
